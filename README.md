# Poker RL DQN

Implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning on the game poker

### Prerequisites

* Pypokerengine
* Keras
* Tensorflow


## Observation

Based on my observation the agent performs a very aggressive gameplay. Thus, it can win on a very high value but it can also lose very quickly.


## Built With

* [Pypokerengine]https://github.com/ishikota/PyPokerEngine - Environment
* [Keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) - Deep Learning Framework
