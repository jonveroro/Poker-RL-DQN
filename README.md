# Poker RL DQN

Implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning on the game poker

### Prerequisites

Pypokerengine
Keras
Tensorflow


## Observation

Based on my observation the agent performs a very aggressive gameplay. Thus, it can win on a very high value but it can also lose very quickly.


## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Built With
